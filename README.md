# TNF is Not Footsies!

## TNF is a simple fighting game heavily inspired by FOOTSIES, a game by HiFight.

### TNF has simple mechanics, like FOOTSIES, such as a long ranged slow normal attack, and other attack, that is faster but short ranged, another special punishable attack, and movements such as dashing and backdashing. 

### But what makes TNF Not [like] Footsies is the fact that now the players have to worry more about the opponent's offense: there are now "low" attacks, "high" attacks and "mid" attacks, so TNF feels more like a modern fighting game. Low attacks can only be blocked if the player blocks while crouching, and high attacks need to be blocked when standing. Mid attacks can be blocked no matter the player's stance.
